Introduction to Python:
Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly
and integrate systems more effectively.
Python's developers typically prioritise readability over performance, Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used.
Python was made to easily read code where even children can learn python, it is 1 of the easiest programming language

Variables in Python :
x=2
x+2
4
x=9
x+2
11
Now I will put value for you
y=4
x+y
13
_+y - underscroll is last output, in this case it is 13
17- answer
Lets start with a name
name= ('jibin')
name+'rocks'
'jibinrocks'
Fetching the letters 
fore.g 
name= ('jibin') 01234
name [0]
j- answer
Now we can use -any number, it will show the number from right side to self, in this case it is 'n'
we can also know the length of a text
e.g: myname= ('jibinraj')
len(myname)- len is the command
8- answer

List in python :
when we use list in python we should you use square brackets to put values in a variable.
nums=[20,30,40,50]
just input nums and then enter
[20,30,40,50]
we can use index numbers also - Indexing in Python is the process of accessing individual elements within a sequence (like a string, list, or tuple) using their position, or "index," within that sequence.
nums[0]
20
nums [2:]
[40, 50]
nums [-1]
50
lets do strings-  In Python, a string is a sequence of characters. For example, "hello" is a string containing a sequence of characters 'h' , 'e' , 'l' , 'l' , and 'o' .
names =['jibin,vardhan,arjun']
names
['jibin,vardhan,arjun']
now lets put some values-
values=[9.5,'jibin',40]
mil= [names, values]
mil
[['jibin,vardhan,arjun'], [9.5, 'jibin', 40]]

Python provides a rich set of built-in functions and methods specifically designed for manipulating lists. These can be categorized as follows:
List Methods-
Let's look at different list methods in Python:
while using list function we need to use parentheses brackets

append(): Adds an element to the end of the list.
copy(): Returns a shallow copy of the list.
clear(): Removes all elements from the list.
count(): Returns the number of times a specified element appears in the list.
extend(): Adds elements from another list to the end of the current list.
index(): Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified element.
insert(): Inserts an element at a specified position.
pop(): Removes and returns the element at the specified position (or the last element if no index is specified).
remove(): Removes the first occurrence of a specified element.
reverse(): Reverses the order of the elements in the list.
sort(): Sorts the list in ascending order (by default).

input- nums[20, 30, 40, 50]
nums.append(60)
nums
[20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
nums.insert(2,35)
nums
[20, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60]
nums.remove(35)
nums
[20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
nums.pop(2)
40
nums.pop()
60
del nums[2:]
nums
[20, 30]
nums.extend([70,80,90,100])
nums
[20, 30, 70, 80, 90, 100]
min(nums)
20
max(nums)
100
nums.sort()
nums
[20, 30, 70, 80, 90, 100]

Tuple and Set in Python :
Set in Python-
A Set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are primarily used when membership tests and eliminating duplicate values are needed.

Mutable: Elements can be added or removed.
Unordered: Does not maintain the order of elements.
Unique Elements: Duplicate values are automatically removed.
Heterogeneous: Can store different data types.
Tuple in Python-
A Tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of elements. Tuples are often used when data should not be modified after creation. In Tuple we use parenthesus or round brackets

Immutable: Once created, elements cannot be modified.
Ordered: Maintains the order of elements.
Allows Duplicates: Can contain duplicate values.
Heterogeneous: Can store different data types.

Python Dictionary :
Python dictionary is a data structure that stores the value in key: value pairs. Values in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be duplicated, whereas keys can't be repeated and must be immutable.

Keys are case sensitive which means same name but different cases of Key will be treated distinctly.
Keys must be immutable which means keys can be strings, numbers or tuples but not lists.
Duplicate keys are not allowed and any duplicate key will overwrite the previous value.
Internally uses hashing. Hence, operations like search, insert, delete can be performed in Constant Time.

Dictionary can be created by placing a sequence of elements within curly {} braces.
Input- d1 = {1: 'Geeks', 2: 'For', 3: 'Geeks'}
print(d1)
output- {1: 'Geeks', 2: 'For', 3: 'Geeks'}

# create dictionary using dict() constructor
Input- d2 = dict(a = "Geeks", b = "for", c = "Geeks")
print(d2)
output- {'a': 'Geeks', 'b': 'for', 'c': 'Geeks'}

Accessing Dictionary Items-
We can access a value from a dictionary by using the key within square brackets or get() method.
d = { "name": "Prajjwal", 1: "Python", (1, 2): [1,2,4] }

# Access using key
print(d["name"])

# Access using get()
print(d.get("name"))
Output
Prajjwal
Prajjwal

Adding and Updating Dictionary Items-
input-d = {1: 'Geeks', 2: 'For', 3: 'Geeks'}

# Adding a new key-value pair
d["age"] = 22

# Updating an existing value
d[1] = "Python dict"

print(d)
output-
{1: 'Python dict', 2: 'For', 3: 'Geeks', 'age': 22}

Removing Dictionary Items-
del: Removes an item by key.
pop(): Removes an item by key and returns its value.
clear(): Empties the dictionary.
popitem(): Removes and returns the last key-value pair.

d = {1: 'Geeks', 2: 'For', 3: 'Geeks', 'age':22}

# Using del to remove an item
del d["age"]
print(d)

# Using pop() to remove an item and return the value
val = d.pop(1)
print(val)

# Using popitem to removes and returns
# the last key-value pair.
key, val = d.popitem()
print(f"Key: {key}, Value: {val}")

# Clear all items from the dictionary
d.clear()
print(d)
output-
{1: 'Geeks', 2: 'For', 3: 'Geeks'}
Geeks
Key: 3, Value: Geeks
{}
