To 60 essential Linux commands

ls command :
This command helps to list the content inside the folder like files.
To list items inside the subfolder use command ls -R

pwd command :
It shows your current working directory.
e.g /home/yourname

cd command :
The cd (Change Directory) command in Linux is used to navigate between directories in the file system.
e.g cd [directory name]
options- cd .. moves a directory up.
         cd - goes back to the previous directory.

mkdir command :
This command helps to create folder.
e.g mkdir folder name

rmdir command :
This command helps to delete empty directories in your Linux system.
The rmdir command won’t work if the directory contains subfolders. To force the deletion, add the –p option.

rm command :
The rm command deletes files from a directory.
e.g rm [options] file1 file2
You can add the -r option to remove a folder and its contents, including subdirectories.

cp command :
Use the cp command to copy files from your current directory to another folder
e.g cp file1 file2 [target_path]

mv command :
The main usage of the mv command is to move a file or folder to another location
e.g mv file_or_directory [target_directory]
You can also use the mv command to rename files in your Linux system. Here’s an example:
e.g mv old_name.txt new_name.txt

 touch command :
 Run the touch command to create a new empty file in a specific directory.
 e.g touch file.txt
 
 file command :
 The file command checks a file type, such as TXT, PDF, or other. The syntax is as follows:
 file [file_name]

 zip and unzip commands :
 The zip command compresses one or multiple files into a ZIP archive, reducing their size.
 e.g zip [options] zip_file_name file1 file2
 To extract a compressed file into your current working directory, use the unzip command like so:
 unzip [options] zip_file_name

  tar command :
  The tar command in Linux is used to create, extract, and manage archive files (typically .tar, .tar.gz, .tgz, .tar.bz2, etc.). The command tar stands for Tape ARchive. Originally, tar was created to write multiple files onto magnetic tape for backups.
Even though we don't use tapes today, the name stayed — and tar is now the standard tool for packaging files into a single archive.
  A. Create a tar archive
  tar -cvf archive_name.tar folder_or_files
  c = create, v = verbose (shows progress), f = file name

  B. Create a compressed archive (gzip)
  e.g tar -czvf backup.tar.gz myfolder/
  z = gzip compression

  C. Extract a tar file for tar.gz
  e.g tar -xzvf backup.tar.gz
  x = extract

  D. View the contents of a tar file
  e.g tar -tvf backup.tar
  t = list contents

cat command :
The cat command in Linux is used to view, create, and combine text files.
A. Display the contents of a file
e.g cat filename.txt

B. Create a new file using cat
cat > newfile.txt
Type your content
Press CTRL + D to save

C. Append (add) text to an existing file
cat >> existingfile.txt
Type your content
Press CTRL + D

D. Number the lines while printing
cat -n filename.txt

grep command :
The grep command is one of the most useful tools in Linux and Unix systems. It is used to search for specific words, phrases, or patterns inside text files, and shows the matching lines on your screen.

e.g grep "python" notes.txt
Commonly Used grep Options:-
1. Case insensitive search:
The -i option enables to search for a string case insensitively in the given file. It matches the words like "UNIX", "Unix", "unix". 
e.g grep -i "UNix" geekfile.txt

2. Display the Matching Filenames Using grep:
We can just display the files that contains the given string/pattern. 
e.g grep -l "unix" *

3. Checking Whole Words Using grep:
The -w option to grep makes it match only the whole words
e.g grep -w "unix" geekfile.txt

4. Display Matched Pattern Using grep:
We can make the grep to display only the matched string by using the -o option. 
e.g grep -o "unix" geekfile.txt

sed command :
The sed command in Linux, short for stream editor, is a non-interactive text editor used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream, such as a file or input from a pipeline
1. Replacing or substituting string:
Sed command is mostly used to replace the text in a file. The below simple sed command replaces the word "unix" with "linux" in the file. Here the "s" specifies the substitution operation. The "/" are delimiters. The "unix" is the search pattern and the "linux" is the replacement string.
e.g sed 's/unix/linux/' geekfile.txt

2. Replacing the nth Occurrence of a Pattern in a Line:
To replace only the nth occurance of a word in a line, Use the '/1', '/2' etc. flags to replace the first, second occurrence of a pattern in a line. The below command replaces the second occurrence of the word "unix" with "linux" in a line.
e.g sed 's/unix/linux/2' geekfile.txt

3. Replacing all the Occurrence of the Pattern in a Line:
we will use the g flag to replace all the occurances of a pattern in a line. The substitute flag /g (global replacement) specifies the sed command to replace all the occurrences of the string in the line.
e.g sed 's/unix/linux/g' geekfile.txt

head command :
The head command is used to display the first few lines of a file.
By default, it shows 10 lines.
Command	              Meaning
head file.txt	       Shows first 10 lines
head -n 5 file.txt	 Shows first 5 lines
head -n 20 file.txt	 Shows first 20 lines
head -c 50 file.txt	 Shows first 50 bytes
head /etc/passwd	   View first 10 lines of system file

 tail command :
 The tail command is used to display the last lines of a file.
By default, it shows the last 10 lines.
Command	          Meaning
tail file.txt	      Shows last 10 lines
tail -n 5 file.txt	Shows last 5 lines
tail -n 20 file.txt	Shows last 20 lines
tail -c 50 file.txt	Shows last 50 bytes
tail -f file.log	  Follow the file (live updates) — useful for logs

sort command :
The sort command arranges lines of text in alphabetical or numerical order.
e.g sort filename
By default:

Sorts alphabetically (A → Z)

Sort in reverse order-
sort -r names.txt

Sort numbers (important!)-
sort -n marks.txt

Sort by a specific column-
sort -k 2 students.txt 2 indicates 2nd column

Remove duplicates while sorting-
sort -u names.TXT

cut command :
The cut command is used to extract specific columns or fields from a line of text.
It works especially well with CSV-like data or delimited text.
Common Options
1️⃣ -d → delimiter

Specify the delimiter (comma, colon, space, etc.)

2️⃣ -f → fields

Pick which fields (columns) to extract.

3️⃣ -c → characters

Extract specific characters from each line.
e.g:-
101,Amit,Developer,45000
102,Ravi,Manager,60000
103,Neha,Tester,40000

1. Extract only the names (2nd column)-
cut -d ',' -f 2 employees.txt

2. Extract the employee ID and salary (1st and 4th columns)-
cut -d ',' -f 1,4 employees.txt

3. Extract only the first 3 characters of each line-
cut -c 1-3 employees.txt

diff command :
The diff command is used to compare two files line-by-line and show the differences between them.
It is very commonly used by developers to:

1. See what changed between two versions of a file

2. Compare configuration files

3. Verify edits

basic command - diff file1 file2

Output Meaning (Very Important)

diff will show lines with symbols:
| Symbol | Meaning                          |
| ------ | -------------------------------- |
| `<`    | Line from **file1** (left file)  |
| `>`    | Line from **file2** (right file) |
| `a`    | Add                              |
| `d`    | Delete                           |
| `c`    | Change                           |
Create the following two files:
file1.txt
apple
banana
orange
grapes
file2.txt
apple
banana
kiwi
grapes
1. Find differences-
diff file1.txt file2.txt

2. View differences in unified format-
diff -u file1.txt file2.txt

3. View differences side-by-side-
diff -y file1.txt file2.txt

tee command :
The tee command outputs another command’s results to both the Terminal and a file. It’s helpful if you want to use the data for further processing or backups. 
e.g  command | tee [options] file_name
purpose-
Displays the output of a program and copies it into a file.

Item    Description
-a	   Adds the output to the end of File instead of writing over it.
-i	   Ignores interrupts.

locate command :
The locate command searches for a file and prints its location path
The locate command in Linux is a fast and efficient tool used to find files by their name. Unlike the find command, it searches through a pre-built database of file paths instead of scanning the entire filesystem, making searches much quicker.
-Used to search and locate files or directories by name.
-Works faster than the find command because it uses a pre-indexed database.
-The database is updated using the updatedb command.
-Newly created files do not appear until the database is refresh

Example 1: Search a File with Specific Name Using locate Command
locate sample.txt 
Updating the database: The updatedb command refreshes the database so newly created files can be found.

find command :
The find command in Linux is used to search for files and directories based on name, type, size, date, or other conditions. It scans the specified directory and its sub directories to locate files matching the given criteria.

-Search based on modification time (e.g., files edited last week).
-Locate files with specific permissions or content.
-Automate tasks like deleting or executing commands on found files.

e.g find [path] [options] [expression]
Path: Where to start searching (e.g., ~/Documents).
Options: Refine your search (e.g., -type for files/directories).
Expression: Criteria like filenames or sizes.

How to find a Specific File Using `find` Command in Linux
This query is designed to identify a file within a designated directory. In the provided example, it seeks a file named "sample.txt" within the "GFG" directory.
e.g find ./GFG -name sample.txt 
The find command traverses the specified directory (./GFG) and looks for a file named "sample.txt." If found, it displays the path to the file.

sudo command :
The sudo (short for Superuser Do) command is one of the most important commands in Linux. It's a prefix you add to other commands to run them with the administrative privileges of another user (by default, the root user).

It's Safer: You don't need to log in as the all-powerful root user for simple tasks. You just "borrow" root's power for one command.
It's Auditable: When a user runs a sudo command, it's logged in /var/log/auth.log. This creates an audit trail, so you know who ran what command and when.
It's Granular: The system administrator can precisely control which users can run which commands using the sudoers file.

To execute a command with elevated privileges, simply prepend sudo to the command:
sudo [command]
To update the package list on a Debian-based system:
sudo apt-get update

su and whoami commands :
The su and whoami commands in Linux are used for user management and identification.
whoami command:
The whoami command displays the username of the current effective user. This is the user ID under which the current process is running. It is useful for quickly confirming which user account is executing commands in the terminal, especially after switching users. 

su command:
The su command, short for "substitute user" or "switch user," allows you to switch to another user account and execute commands with that user's permissions. By default, if no username is specified, su attempts to switch to the root user. You will be prompted to enter the password of the target user.
Example:
To switch to the root user-
su
To switch to a specific user named john-
su john

Key differences and uses:
-whoami is for identifying the current user.
-su is for changing the current user to another, potentially with elevated privileges (like root).
-su requires the password of the target user, while sudo (a related command for elevated privileges) typically requires the password of the current user.

chmod command :
Chmod lets you change the permissions of files or directories.
Every file in Linux has an owner, a group, and associated permissions that determine who can read, write, or execute the file. Using chmod, Administrators and users can control these permissions to ensure proper access and security. 
In Linux, file permissions are typically listed in the order of user, group, others (or owner, group, others)
In a permission string like -rwxrw-r--, the order is:
User: rwx (read, write, and execute)
Group: rw- (read and write)
Others: r-- (read only)
This is often represented in octal code, where the first digit is the user's permissions, the second is for the group, and the third is for others
In Linux/Unix file permissions, each r, w, and x corresponds to a specific numerical value, which are then added up to form an octal number (0-7) for each set of permissions. 
The individual numbers are:
r (read) = 4
w (write) = 2
x (execute) = 1
- (no permission) = 0
