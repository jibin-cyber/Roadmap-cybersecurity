This File Will contain the fundamentals of IT.

The core components of computer system:

cpu- 
Often dubbed the "brain" of the computer, the CPU is responsible for executing instructions, performing arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the software. It is a highly complex integrated circuit.

Function: Processes data, performs calculations, and manages overall system operations.
Key Specifications:
Cores: Independent processing units within the CPU. A multi-core CPU can execute multiple instructions simultaneously.
Threads: Virtual components of a CPU core that manage tasks. Each core can often handle two threads (hyper-threading/SMT), improving multitasking.
Clock Speed (GHz): Measures the number of cycles the CPU can execute per second. Higher clock speeds generally mean faster performance, though core count and architecture are equally important.
Cache: Small, fast memory (L1, L2, L3) built directly into the CPU to store frequently accessed data, reducing the need to access slower RAM.
Manufacturers: The primary manufacturers are Intel (e.g., Core i3/i5/i7/i9, Xeon) and AMD (e.g., Ryzen 3/5/7/9, Threadripper, EPYC).
Socket Types: The physical connector on the motherboard where the CPU is installed. CPU and motherboard sockets must be compatible (e.g., LGA 1700 for Intel, AM5 for AMD).

Motherboard
The motherboard, or mainboard, serves as the central communication backbone of the computer. It's a large printed circuit board that connects all the computer's components, allowing them to communicate and receive power.

Function: Provides the electrical connections and logical pathways for all other hardware components to interact.

Key Components:
CPU Socket: Where the CPU is installed.
RAM Slots (DIMM Slots): Where memory modules are inserted.
Chipset: A set of integrated circuits that manages data flow between the CPU, RAM, storage, and peripherals. It acts as a data traffic controller.
Expansion Slots (PCIe Slots): Used for installing expansion cards like graphics cards, sound cards, and network cards. Modern systems primarily use PCI Express (PCIe).
Storage Connectors:
SATA (Serial ATA): For connecting traditional hard drives (HDDs) and 2.5-inch Solid State Drives (SSDs).
M.2 Slots: For connecting high-speed NVMe SSDs, which offer significantly faster performance than SATA.
I/O Panel: Provides external ports for connecting peripherals (USB, Ethernet, audio jacks, video outputs).
Form Factors: Defines the motherboard's physical dimensions and mounting hole layout, influencing case compatibility. Common sizes include ATX, Micro-ATX, and Mini-ITX.

Threads:-
Definition of a Thread (in CPU context)

A thread is the smallest unit of processing that a CPU can handle.
It represents a single sequence of instructions that the CPU executes independently.
In (Simple Terms):-

Think of a core as a worker, and a thread as a task that worker can perform.
Some cores can handle two tasks (threads) at the same time — this is called Hyper-Threading (in Intel CPUs).

(A)How are threads divided to cores, this is an example of intel i5?

| Specification                        | Value |
| ------------------------------------ | ----- |
| **Total Cores**                      | 10    |
| **Performance (P) Cores**            | 2     |
| **Efficient (E) Cores**              | 8     |
| **Low Power Efficient (LP-E) Cores** | 0     |
| **Total Threads**                    | 12    |
⚙️ Thread Distribution Logic:-

Intel’s hybrid architecture (used in 12th, 13th, and 14th gen Core CPUs) divides cores into:

P-cores (Performance cores): Support Hyper-Threading → 2 threads per core

E-cores (Efficient cores): Do not support Hyper-Threading → 1 thread per core
Calculation:-
| Core Type             | # of Cores | Threads per Core | Total Threads    |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Performance (P) Cores | 2          | 2                | **4 threads**    |
| Efficient (E) Cores   | 8          | 1                | **8 threads**    |
| **Total**             | **10**     |                  | **12 threads** ✅ |
Summary:-

So, your Intel Core i5 (most likely a 12th–14th Gen model like i5-13400 or i5-13600) has:

2 P-cores → 4 threads

8 E-cores → 8 threads
Total: 12 threads

Random Access Memory (RAM)
RAM is a form of volatile computer memory that stores data and program instructions currently being used by the CPU. Unlike long-term storage, RAM is extremely fast but loses its contents when the power is turned off.

Function: Provides high-speed, temporary storage for active programs and data, allowing the CPU quick access.
Types: Modern desktop and laptop systems primarily use DDR (Double Data Rate) synchronous dynamic RAM.
DDR4: Common in older systems, still widely used.
DDR5: Newer standard offering higher speeds and bandwidth.
Specifications:
Capacity (GB): The total amount of data RAM can hold (e.g., 8GB, 16GB, 32GB). More RAM generally allows for smoother multitasking and handling of larger applications.
Speed (MHz/MT/s): The rate at which data can be transferred. Higher speeds lead to better performance.
Latency (CL): A measure of the delay between a command being issued and data being retrieved. Lower latency is better.

Storage Devices
Storage devices are responsible for long-term retention of data, applications, and the operating system, even when the computer is powered off.

Function: Non-volatile storage for permanent data.
Types:
Hard Disk Drives (HDDs):
Mechanism: Utilize spinning platters and read/write heads to store data magnetically.
Characteristics: High capacity for a low cost, but slower due to mechanical parts.
Speed: Measured in Revolutions Per Minute (RPM), commonly 5400 RPM or 7200 RPM.
Solid State Drives (SSDs):
Mechanism: Use flash memory (NAND) to store data electronically. No moving parts.
Characteristics: Significantly faster, more durable, and consume less power than HDDs. More expensive per gigabyte.
Interfaces:
SATA SSDs: Connect via SATA III, offering speeds up to 600 MB/s.
NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) SSDs: Connect via PCIe slots (often M.2 form factor), offering much higher speeds (thousands of MB/s) by directly communicating with the CPU.
Hybrid Drives (SSHDs): Combine a small amount of SSD-like flash memory with a traditional HDD to offer a balance of speed for frequently accessed files and large capacity.

Connection Types and their function:-
There are several types of network connections that enable communication between devices, each serving different functions based on speed, reliability, and purpose. 
Ethernet is a wired connection type commonly used in local area networks (LANs), providing high-speed, stable, and secure data transfer. Ethernet is ideal for businesses and environments where reliability is crucial, offering speeds from 100 Mbps to several Gbps.

Wi-Fi, a wireless connection, enables devices to connect to a network without physical cables. It provides flexibility and mobility, making it popular in homes, offices, and public spaces. While Wi-Fi offers convenience, it can be less reliable and slower than Ethernet due to signal interference or distance from the access point.

Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology primarily used for connecting peripherals like headphones, keyboards, and other devices. It operates over shorter distances, typically up to 10 meters, and is useful for personal device communication rather than networking larger systems.

Fiber-optic connections use light signals through glass or plastic fibers to transmit data at very high speeds over long distances, making them ideal for internet backbones or connecting data centers. Fiber is faster and more reliable than traditional copper cables, but it is also more expensive to implement.

Cellular connections, such as 4G and 5G, allow mobile devices to connect to the internet via wireless cellular networks. These connections offer mobility, enabling internet access from almost anywhere, but their speeds and reliability can vary depending on network coverage.

Each connection type plays a specific role, balancing factors like speed, distance, and convenience to meet the varying needs of users and organizations.
