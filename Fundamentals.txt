This File Will contain the fundamentals of IT.

The core components of computer system:

cpu- 
Often dubbed the "brain" of the computer, the CPU is responsible for executing instructions, performing arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the software. It is a highly complex integrated circuit.

Function: Processes data, performs calculations, and manages overall system operations.
Key Specifications:
Cores: Independent processing units within the CPU. A multi-core CPU can execute multiple instructions simultaneously.
Threads: Virtual components of a CPU core that manage tasks. Each core can often handle two threads (hyper-threading/SMT), improving multitasking.
Clock Speed (GHz): Measures the number of cycles the CPU can execute per second. Higher clock speeds generally mean faster performance, though core count and architecture are equally important.
Cache: Small, fast memory (L1, L2, L3) built directly into the CPU to store frequently accessed data, reducing the need to access slower RAM.
Manufacturers: The primary manufacturers are Intel (e.g., Core i3/i5/i7/i9, Xeon) and AMD (e.g., Ryzen 3/5/7/9, Threadripper, EPYC).
Socket Types: The physical connector on the motherboard where the CPU is installed. CPU and motherboard sockets must be compatible (e.g., LGA 1700 for Intel, AM5 for AMD).

Motherboard
The motherboard, or mainboard, serves as the central communication backbone of the computer. It's a large printed circuit board that connects all the computer's components, allowing them to communicate and receive power.

Function: Provides the electrical connections and logical pathways for all other hardware components to interact.

Key Components:
CPU Socket: Where the CPU is installed.
RAM Slots (DIMM Slots): Where memory modules are inserted.
Chipset: A set of integrated circuits that manages data flow between the CPU, RAM, storage, and peripherals. It acts as a data traffic controller.
Expansion Slots (PCIe Slots): Used for installing expansion cards like graphics cards, sound cards, and network cards. Modern systems primarily use PCI Express (PCIe).
Storage Connectors:
SATA (Serial ATA): For connecting traditional hard drives (HDDs) and 2.5-inch Solid State Drives (SSDs).
M.2 Slots: For connecting high-speed NVMe SSDs, which offer significantly faster performance than SATA.
I/O Panel: Provides external ports for connecting peripherals (USB, Ethernet, audio jacks, video outputs).
Form Factors: Defines the motherboard's physical dimensions and mounting hole layout, influencing case compatibility. Common sizes include ATX, Micro-ATX, and Mini-ITX.
