This File Will contain the fundamentals of IT.

The core components of computer system:

cpu- 
Often dubbed the "brain" of the computer, the CPU is responsible for executing instructions, performing arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the software. It is a highly complex integrated circuit.

Function: Processes data, performs calculations, and manages overall system operations.
Key Specifications:
Cores: Independent processing units within the CPU. A multi-core CPU can execute multiple instructions simultaneously.
Threads: Virtual components of a CPU core that manage tasks. Each core can often handle two threads (hyper-threading/SMT), improving multitasking.
Clock Speed (GHz): Measures the number of cycles the CPU can execute per second. Higher clock speeds generally mean faster performance, though core count and architecture are equally important.
Cache: Small, fast memory (L1, L2, L3) built directly into the CPU to store frequently accessed data, reducing the need to access slower RAM.
Manufacturers: The primary manufacturers are Intel (e.g., Core i3/i5/i7/i9, Xeon) and AMD (e.g., Ryzen 3/5/7/9, Threadripper, EPYC).
Socket Types: The physical connector on the motherboard where the CPU is installed. CPU and motherboard sockets must be compatible (e.g., LGA 1700 for Intel, AM5 for AMD).

Motherboard
The motherboard, or mainboard, serves as the central communication backbone of the computer. It's a large printed circuit board that connects all the computer's components, allowing them to communicate and receive power.

Function: Provides the electrical connections and logical pathways for all other hardware components to interact.

Key Components:
CPU Socket: Where the CPU is installed.
RAM Slots (DIMM Slots): Where memory modules are inserted.
Chipset: A set of integrated circuits that manages data flow between the CPU, RAM, storage, and peripherals. It acts as a data traffic controller.
Expansion Slots (PCIe Slots): Used for installing expansion cards like graphics cards, sound cards, and network cards. Modern systems primarily use PCI Express (PCIe).
Storage Connectors:
SATA (Serial ATA): For connecting traditional hard drives (HDDs) and 2.5-inch Solid State Drives (SSDs).
M.2 Slots: For connecting high-speed NVMe SSDs, which offer significantly faster performance than SATA.
I/O Panel: Provides external ports for connecting peripherals (USB, Ethernet, audio jacks, video outputs).
Form Factors: Defines the motherboard's physical dimensions and mounting hole layout, influencing case compatibility. Common sizes include ATX, Micro-ATX, and Mini-ITX.

Threads:-
Definition of a Thread (in CPU context)

A thread is the smallest unit of processing that a CPU can handle.
It represents a single sequence of instructions that the CPU executes independently.
In (Simple Terms):-

Think of a core as a worker, and a thread as a task that worker can perform.
Some cores can handle two tasks (threads) at the same time — this is called Hyper-Threading (in Intel CPUs).

(A)How are threads divided to cores, this is an example of intel i5?

| Specification                        | Value |
| ------------------------------------ | ----- |
| **Total Cores**                      | 10    |
| **Performance (P) Cores**            | 2     |
| **Efficient (E) Cores**              | 8     |
| **Low Power Efficient (LP-E) Cores** | 0     |
| **Total Threads**                    | 12    |
⚙️ Thread Distribution Logic:-

Intel’s hybrid architecture (used in 12th, 13th, and 14th gen Core CPUs) divides cores into:

P-cores (Performance cores): Support Hyper-Threading → 2 threads per core

E-cores (Efficient cores): Do not support Hyper-Threading → 1 thread per core
Calculation:-
| Core Type             | # of Cores | Threads per Core | Total Threads    |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Performance (P) Cores | 2          | 2                | **4 threads**    |
| Efficient (E) Cores   | 8          | 1                | **8 threads**    |
| **Total**             | **10**     |                  | **12 threads** ✅ |
Summary:-

So, your Intel Core i5 (most likely a 12th–14th Gen model like i5-13400 or i5-13600) has:

2 P-cores → 4 threads

8 E-cores → 8 threads
Total: 12 threads

Random Access Memory (RAM)
RAM is a form of volatile computer memory that stores data and program instructions currently being used by the CPU. Unlike long-term storage, RAM is extremely fast but loses its contents when the power is turned off.

Function: Provides high-speed, temporary storage for active programs and data, allowing the CPU quick access.
Types: Modern desktop and laptop systems primarily use DDR (Double Data Rate) synchronous dynamic RAM.
DDR4: Common in older systems, still widely used.
DDR5: Newer standard offering higher speeds and bandwidth.
Specifications:
Capacity (GB): The total amount of data RAM can hold (e.g., 8GB, 16GB, 32GB). More RAM generally allows for smoother multitasking and handling of larger applications.
Speed (MHz/MT/s): The rate at which data can be transferred. Higher speeds lead to better performance.
Latency (CL): A measure of the delay between a command being issued and data being retrieved. Lower latency is better.

Storage Devices
Storage devices are responsible for long-term retention of data, applications, and the operating system, even when the computer is powered off.

Function: Non-volatile storage for permanent data.
Types:
Hard Disk Drives (HDDs):
Mechanism: Utilize spinning platters and read/write heads to store data magnetically.
Characteristics: High capacity for a low cost, but slower due to mechanical parts.
Speed: Measured in Revolutions Per Minute (RPM), commonly 5400 RPM or 7200 RPM.
Solid State Drives (SSDs):
Mechanism: Use flash memory (NAND) to store data electronically. No moving parts.
Characteristics: Significantly faster, more durable, and consume less power than HDDs. More expensive per gigabyte.
Interfaces:
SATA SSDs: Connect via SATA III, offering speeds up to 600 MB/s.
NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) SSDs: Connect via PCIe slots (often M.2 form factor), offering much higher speeds (thousands of MB/s) by directly communicating with the CPU.
Hybrid Drives (SSHDs): Combine a small amount of SSD-like flash memory with a traditional HDD to offer a balance of speed for frequently accessed files and large capacity.

Connection Types and their function:-
There are several types of network connections that enable communication between devices, each serving different functions based on speed, reliability, and purpose. 
Ethernet is a wired connection type commonly used in local area networks (LANs), providing high-speed, stable, and secure data transfer. Ethernet is ideal for businesses and environments where reliability is crucial, offering speeds from 100 Mbps to several Gbps.

Wi-Fi, a wireless connection, enables devices to connect to a network without physical cables. It provides flexibility and mobility, making it popular in homes, offices, and public spaces. While Wi-Fi offers convenience, it can be less reliable and slower than Ethernet due to signal interference or distance from the access point.

Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology primarily used for connecting peripherals like headphones, keyboards, and other devices. It operates over shorter distances, typically up to 10 meters, and is useful for personal device communication rather than networking larger systems.

Fiber-optic connections use light signals through glass or plastic fibers to transmit data at very high speeds over long distances, making them ideal for internet backbones or connecting data centers. Fiber is faster and more reliable than traditional copper cables, but it is also more expensive to implement.

Cellular connections, such as 4G and 5G, allow mobile devices to connect to the internet via wireless cellular networks. These connections offer mobility, enabling internet access from almost anywhere, but their speeds and reliability can vary depending on network coverage.

Each connection type plays a specific role, balancing factors like speed, distance, and convenience to meet the varying needs of users and organizations.

🔹 Bluetooth in Cybersecurity
🧠 What is Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is a wireless communication technology used for exchanging data over short distances (typically up to 10 meters) using radio waves. It's widely used in devices like smartphones, headsets, IoT devices, cars, keyboards, and wearables.

⚠️ Security Risks in Bluetooth

Bluejacking

Sending unsolicited messages to Bluetooth-enabled devices.

Mostly harmless but can be used for phishing or social engineering.

Bluesnarfing

Unauthorized access to information on a Bluetooth-enabled device.

Attackers can steal contacts, messages, or files if the device is set to discoverable mode.

Bluebugging

Grants the attacker control of the target device.

They might make calls, send messages, or access internet services secretly.

Bluetooth Impersonation (BIAS)

A vulnerability that allows attackers to spoof legitimate device identities.

Enables unauthorized pairing or access.

Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

Intercepting data between two connected Bluetooth devices.

Often exploited during insecure pairing processes.

Denial of Service (DoS)

Flooding the Bluetooth channel to prevent legitimate use.

Can disable or crash Bluetooth services.

🔐 Bluetooth Security Measures

Use Secure Simple Pairing (SSP)
Uses encryption and authentication, especially with numeric comparison or passkey entry.

Turn Off Bluetooth When Not In Use
Reduces exposure and chance of unauthorized access.

Use "Non-Discoverable" or "Invisible" Mode
Makes it harder for attackers to detect your device.

Regular Device Updates
Manufacturers often patch known vulnerabilities.

Use Trusted Devices Only
Don't accept pairing or file transfer requests from unknown sources.

Application-Level Encryption
Even if Bluetooth is compromised, data remains safe.

🔍 Bluetooth in Ethical Hacking

Ethical hackers use tools like BlueMaho, BlueBorne, and BTScanner to test vulnerabilities.

Security assessments help organizations secure Bluetooth-enabled IoT and mobile devices.

WiFi:-
WiFi is a wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to the internet and communicate with each other without physical cables. It uses radio waves to transmit data, typically operating on the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands. WiFi networks are created by wireless routers or access points and can be found in homes, offices, public spaces, and many other locations. The technology follows IEEE 802.11 standards, with newer versions (like WiFi 6 or 802.11ax) offering increased speeds, better performance in crowded areas, and improved energy efficiency. WiFi enables the proliferation of mobile and smart devices, supporting the Internet of Things (IoT) and allowing for greater flexibility and mobility in network connectivity.

Infrared:-
Infrared refers (IR) to a wireless mobile method that transfers data over short-to-mid ranges in order for devices to communicate. It has a longer wavelength than visible light but shorter than radio waves. IR radiation is not visible to the human eye, but only specific electronic sensors and cameras can detect it. Yet infrared has limitations, including a limited range, line-of-sight limitations, limited data transfer rate, susceptibility to interference, limited penetration, and security risks. Hackers still manage to misuse this technology to their advantage.

Infrared misusage
Spoofing devices on the same network. Infrared smart light bulbs can serve as the ideal solution for hackers to spoof all connected devices on one Wi-Fi network. Then, they can cause data leaks or steal confidential data, such as IP addresses.
Hackers can control the infrared wave. Once they intercept the connection, they will be able to constantly monitor the data that two devices share and steal data users store on their computers, such as login credentials, messages, and emails. Such hacking requires advanced technical knowledge and equipment and is therefore less common than other types of attacks.
Steal IoT data. As many IoT devices utilize infrared bulbs, hackers can use them to exploit vulnerabilities and steal sensitive user data.
Monitor security cameras. By intercepting infrared waves, hackers can access the company’s security cameras, which may assist hackers in monitoring the company's actions and entering their security system through the cameras.
